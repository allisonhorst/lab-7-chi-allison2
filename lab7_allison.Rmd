I'm Allison and I'm adding some text here to see if my collaborators can get this file. 

It's Allison again, and I'm updating some text.
Blah blah blah

I'm the collaborator adding something...

Creator (Allison): 

Getting gc_df.csv data, loading the tidyverse, and getting some summary counts

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female","Male")

```
